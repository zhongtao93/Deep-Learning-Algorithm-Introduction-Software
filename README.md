Using C++ and QML to develop it.

It is designed for deep learning beginners who barely have basic knowledges on deep learning. It is based on Caffe framework.By using this software, users can complete a variety of different deep learning experiments on a user-friendly interface. The software can easily analyze the deep network structure and exhibit the training and testing process of deep learning algorithm with the necessary dataset and the corresponding network structure profiles provided by users.
